Git commit -"Update RethaNova Flagellar Motor Detection website with interactive layout and styling"

This commit enhances the RethaNova Flagellar Motor Detection website, a scientific platform designed to support the detection and analysis of bacterial flagellar motors using cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) and machine learning. Key updates include a modern, modular layout with a responsive design, a high contrast deep blue and bio green color scheme, and improved accessibility for research users. Interactive components and hover effects have been refined, and JavaScript features are being added to make the site fully functional, enabling dynamic user experiences, real time interactivity, and future integration of AI-powered elements such as chatbot support and 3D visualization tools.
